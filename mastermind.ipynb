    "I started using Gemini about a month ago, so although I've never tried to build a neural network, recently I've been thinking more about them. While staring at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)\">Mastermind</a> board my kids left out, I started thinking about whether I could build a neural network to solve it. This would be overpowered, of course. While researching the game, I quickly stumbled across Donald Knuth's algorithm, which I immediately stopped reading about so I could think it through and implement it myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan here, I think, is:\n",
    "1. Build a game environment.\n",
    "2. Implement Knuth's algorithm.\n",
    "3. Build a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game environment should be able to return the latest result or all results; I gather I shouldn't ask my neural network to manage the game's history. I may try to build the neural network myself using NumPy. I just discovered <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3\">this playlist</a>, and I've been meaning to revisit the first few videos of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi\">3blue1brown's</a> for the ?th time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial thoughts for the game environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "class Mastermind:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, return_history=False, seed=None):\n",
    "        self.secret = None\n",
    "        self.return_history = return_history\n",
    "        self.history = []\n",
    "        self.reset(seed)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def reset(self, seed=None):\n",
    "        if seed is not None:\n",
    "            random.seed(seed)\n",
    "        self.secret = random.choices(range(1, 7), k=4)\n",
    "        self.history.clear()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def step(self, guess):\n",
    "        # score guess; determine how many black and white pegs\n",
    "        # append (guess, score) to history\n",
    "        return self.history[:] if self.return_history else self.history[-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that I think about it, I'm not sure what data structure I'll need to feed into the neural network. But I can work that out when I get there."

    "During my neural network studying, I wondered how many output neurons I should have for Mastermind. I think I should use one-hot encoding, with each possible color of each peg having its own neuron, so I'll have $4 \\times 6 = 24$ output neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm starting to see a lot of possible issues with the input neurons, though. I could represent each previous guess and score with $4 \\times 6 + 2 \\times 5 = 34$ neurons, and there are a maximum of 9 previous guesses so that's $9 \\times 34 = 306$ input neurons. Maybe that's a lot? But here are some definite concerns:\n",
    "1. Much of the history will be empty/missing. I gather these inputs could be set to zero. Maybe the first layer biases as well?\n",
    "2. The order of previous guesses doesn't matter. I feel that brute-forcing through this would make training exponentially more difficult/expensive. I asked Gemini for some topics to look into: permutation invariance, set processing, aggregation functions and pooling, embedding functions, and deep sets. Among others. I may have picked a project that doesn't lend itself to a simple neural network.\n",
    "3. The different colors are interchangeable. This one, it seems, a neural network may actually be well suited to learn.\n",
